Using the untested Rearden Metal, they rebuild the critical Taggart rail line in Colorado and pave the way for oil titan Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel) to feed the flame of a new American Renaissance. Hope rises again, when Dagny and Rearden discover the design of a revolutionary motor based on static electricity - in an abandoned engine factory - more proof to the sinister theory that the \"men of the mind\" (thinkers, industrialists, scientists, artists, and other innovators) are \"on strike\" and vanishing from society. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/57/11155716_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/57/11155716_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/57/11155716_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/15/57/11155716_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Taylor Schilling","characters":["Dagny Taggart"]},{"name":"Matthew Marsden","characters":["James Taggart"]},{"name":"Grant Bowler","characters":["Henry \"Hank\" Rearden","Henry Reardon"]},{"name":"Edi Gathegi","characters":["Eddie Willers"]},{"name":"Nick Cassavetes","characters":["Richard McNamara"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843.json","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843/reviews.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_part_i/"}},{"id":"771205000","title":"The Princess Of Montpensier","year":2011,"runtime":139,"release_dates":{"theater":"2011-04-15"},"ratings":{"critics_score":83,"audience_score":60},"synopsis":"France, 1562.

When he is called away to battle, her husband leaves her in the care of Count Chabannes (Lambert Wilson), an aging nobleman with a disdain for warfare. As he experiences his own forbidden desire for Marie, Chabannes must also protect her from the dangerously corrupt court dominated by Catherine de Medici. Director Tavernier translates Madame de Lafayette's 1622 novella into a bracingly intelligent and moving evocation of the terrible conflict between duty and passion.

Director Janus Metz follows Danish soldiers fighting the Taliban in the Helmand province of southern Afghanistan with sophisticated visual artistry rarely achieved under such raw conditions. Building his film around the characters within the platoon, Metz allows us to witness how war transforms the different personalities, and the group, approaching his subjects with an intimacy equal to that of fiction. The active military base \"Armadillo\" houses a mix of 170 Danish and British soldiers in the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) who are responsible for providing security to the surrounding area and eliminating the Taliban insurgency. Metz follows his subjects through an entire tour of duty, creating an unforgettable portrait of the reality of military life on the front lines. Documenting both the boredom and horror of warfare, Metz shows us the soldiers playing video games and laughing at pornography, struggling to communicate with disillusioned civilians, and killing a group of Taliban soldiers found hiding in a trench. The film avoids judgments for or against the war, and instead shows the soldiers struggling to maintain their humanity in a world filled with violence.-- (c) New Yorker","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/52/11155245_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/52/11155245_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/52/11155245_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/52/11155245_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ronnie Fridthjof"},{"name":"Sara Stockmann"}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206367.json","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206367/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771206367/reviews.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/armadillo_2010/"}},{"id":"771035611","title":"Footprints","year":2010,"runtime":80,"release_dates":{"theater":"2011-04-15"},"ratings":{"critics_score":10,"audience_score":93},"synopsis":"Sybil Temtchine (Ten Benny, Passion of Ayn Rand) stars as a young woman who wakes up at dawn on the handprints and footprints of the famed Chinese Theatre in Hollywood with no idea who she or how she got there. Upon awakening, she wonders if she isn't, in fact, lost in a dream. And perhaps she is. Regardless of whether she is dreaming or wide awake, Our Gal sets off on her journey, from one person to the next, one famous locale after the other. Among the Hollywood fringe denizens with whom she comes into contact are a pair of tour guides (Charley Rossman, John Brickner), two super hero impersonators (Catherine Bruhier, Riley Weston), a Scientology auditor (Joe Roseto), and a memorabilia shop owner (R.J. Cantu). She also finds herself disquietingly followed by a Stranger (Kirk Bovill) who may be real or a figment of her unsteady imagination. Although her feet only fleetingly leave Hollywood Boulevard, by sundown Our Gal will piece together the revelatory truth about her existence and the reason for her awakening, forcing her to make choices that will literally result in either her life... or death. In their heart-breaking portrayals of two veterans of the boulevard and all it represents, FOOTPRINTS marks the return to the big screen of The Searchers' Pippa Scott and H. M.

Shot in Chad, portraying the psychological fall-out of an endless civil war, A SCREAMING MAN is titled ironically, from a director who credits Ozu as his strongest influence. Adam is a former swimming medalist, now a 60-year-old hotel employee and head \"pool man,\" who maintains this calm oasis as much for his own benefit as for the hotel's Western guests. The tensions between Adam and Abdel, his adult son, are exacerbated when he loses his job to the younger man and their fragile world begins to crumble. Complicating their relationship is the fact that rebel forces are at war with the authorities, and civilians like Adam and Abdel are under pressure to support the government. With subtlety and grace, Haroun's modern fable eschews histrionics for a smart, restrained, yet deeply feeling drama in which personality, politics and place define its characters' reality.

Blowing lines with kids half his age, making it rain in strip clubs, and voraciously pawing naive girls with \"JUICY\" tagged across their rears are all part of Phillip's relentless pursuit of the endless summer. He chuckles along as the carefree town jester, but beneath this suffocating guise Phillip feels increasingly isolated in the dead end rut he has so comfortably dug. The chance to pull himself out comes when an old love returns home and the opportunity to run his own landscaping business knocks. But before Phillip can dust himself off he must first ditch the woefully insecure seventeen year-old that's been his shadow for the last month. With her jealous, steroid-pumping ex in his grill and a best friend returning from Iraq with an acutely hostile form of PTSD, it isn't long before Phillip gets tangled in a tornado of violence that may tarnish his future forever. Filmed in a brutal, stripped-down fashion, Phillip The Fossil is an uncompromising and realistic portrait of everyday people who struggle in all their blemished glory for a life of balance, control and meaning. --(c) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/68/11156849_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/68/11156849_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/68/11156849_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/68/11156849_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Brian Hasenfus"},{"name":"Nick Dellarocca"},{"name":"Ann Palica"},{"name":"Angela Pagliarulo"},{"name":"J.R.
